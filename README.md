# Water Editor

Garry's Mod addon that adds a Water Editor entity, as well as console commands to perform the same functionality.

Current features:

- Changing water fog

- Disabling (or at least reducing) underwater blur

- Disabling the ugly floating dirt particles

There may be more features in the future.

See the Workshop page for more info... whenever I get around to making it :p

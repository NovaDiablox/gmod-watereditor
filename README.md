# Water Editor

Garry's Mod addon that adds a Water Editor entity, as well as console commands to perform the same functionality.

Currently, the main feature is to be able to change water fog in maps. There might be more features in the future, but no concrete plans as of right now.

See the Workshop page for more info... whenever I get around to making it :p
